#Tag and view photos in linux

These are some silly little scripts so I can view all photos with a tag and append new tags to a
photo right in feh. exiftool does all the heavy lifting.

##Intention

The intention is that set/add scripts are set up as "actions" in feh so I can tag an image while
looking at it. Feh is quite nice and light.

##Dependencies
* zenity: for showing a gui prompt box
* exiftool: all the actual metadata manipulation\
